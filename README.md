# practice
The first file titled ceaser cipher is used for encryption and decryption
A user wants to send an encrypted message to another person
Then shift comes in
Let's say i want to send a message 'hello' with a shift of 5
You are gonna start counting from h which is 1 till you get to the 5th letter, then 'h' would be represented with that next number
Same goes for the other number

Decryption is the opposite

The next file is one that checks for prime numbers
It checks whether the input is a prime number or not and then tells you the result
